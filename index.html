    <!--write-up
	    I decided to fill the screen with each section of my page to give it a more modern look.
	    I chose to talk about music and introduce my religion because they are both very significance in my life. 
	    Throughout this project, I struggled to section the page the way I imagined it.
	    It is so easy to design but much harder to execute.

            <h2>composition</h2>
            <p>
              One day, I dream of publishing my own music! I seem to give up way
              too easily, more specifically, whenever my work doesn't turn out
              the way I imagined it. I want to read and write music sheets. I
              have musical ideas but I struggle to document them.

            <h2>inspiration</h2>
            <p>
              An artist I'm currently inspired by is Mishaal Tamer, he's from
              Saudi Arabia. It's amazing when there is an artist of the same
              culture as you. He fasts for ramadan too, and shares the same
              values. I appreciate it a lot.

            <h2>quran</h2>
            <p>
              This is a book written by god, and I use quran.com to read it. To
              think that god wrote a book, maintained it for hundreds of years,
              and made it so that even today we can still read and understand
              it.. that's a very fascinating thought. Reading it is an even more
              of a fascinating experience. My Arabic journey has seen great
              improvement, it almost feels like a miracle.
